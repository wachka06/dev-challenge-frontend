# Welcome to the UA5 Frontend Test

### Hereâ€™s the final goal

Once you complete the challenge, you'll:

- You send us a github link to your repo
- We'll run `npm install` and `npm run start` to view your result

## The Test

- Use React to build out what you see in [this Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/b2kwO88yZdRqLhuhBpQuUB/UA5-Developer-Quiz?node-id=0%3A1).
- It contains two carousels, each with different content, and one has blue text.
- Please find a good carousel dependency to use and don't rebuild the wheel.
- Grab the data.json file from here to use for the carousel content.
- We also want you to take a stab at responsive styling. The design is only the desktop version, but it also needs to look good on mobile.

### What we're looking for:

- How closely it resembles the original design
- How you organize your react components
- Reusability
- How you organize typography
- How you're able to do a mobile version without a strict design
